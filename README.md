# What is Metal or Poetry?

I made this little game /  because I love heavy metal, and I love poetry. 

People don't realise just how poetic heavy metal lyrics can be. 
This game intends to bring shame to poets, and joy to metal heads, and vice versa.

I did it for fun.

I'm not a professional developer so there's probably many ways it can be improved.
